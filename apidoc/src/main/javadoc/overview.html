Elemento is a modern, type-safe Java library for building web user interfaces using
<a href="https://www.gwtproject.org/">GWT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl">J2CL</a>.
It provides a fluent builder API that makes creating and manipulating DOM elements natural and intuitive,
eliminating the verbosity of traditional DOM manipulation.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Elemento simplifies web development by offering:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Fluent Builder API</b>: Create complex DOM hierarchies with clean, readable code</li>
    <li><b>Type Safety</b>: Leverage Java's type system to catch errors at compile time</li>
    <li><b>Modular Architecture</b>: Choose only the modules you need for your application</li>
    <li><b>Modern Web Standards</b>: Support for Custom Elements, SVG, MathML, and more</li>
    <li><b>Developer Friendly</b>: Intuitive APIs that reduce boilerplate and improve productivity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modules</h2>

<p><img src="doc-files/dependency-graph.png" alt="Elemento Module Dependencies"/></p>

<p>Elemento is structured as a set of modules with <b>elemento-core</b> at the foundation. The core module provides
    the essential builder API for creating and manipulating HTML elements, event handling, type-safe CSS selectors,
    and utilities for DOM traversal and manipulation.</p>

<p>Additional optional modules build on top of the core: <b>elemento-router</b> for single-page application routing,
    <b>elemento-flow</b> for asynchronous task control flow, <b>elemento-logger</b> for lightweight logging,
    <b>elemento-intl</b> for internationalization support, <b>elemento-svg</b> for SVG element creation,
    and <b>elemento-mathml</b> for mathematical notation. Each module can be used independently based on your
    application's needs.</p>
