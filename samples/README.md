# Elemento Samples

This folder contains different [implementations](https://hal.github.io/elemento/index.html) of the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application. 
 
- [GWT](https://hal.github.io/elemento/gwt/index.html): Based GWT and Elemento
- [J2CL](https://hal.github.io/elemento/j2cl/index.html): Based J2CL and Elemento
- [Crysknife](https://hal.github.io/elemento/crysknife/index.html): Based on J2CL, Elemento, Crysknife CDI and Crysknife templates

All samples use the same key to persist the todo items in the local storage. So you can switch between the samples and continue working on your tasks seamlessly ;-)
